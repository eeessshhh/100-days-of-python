            Python Loops

A loop allows us to execute the same line of code multiple times. 

    游늸For Loop Example:

fruits = ["apple","banana","chikoo"]
for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)
  print(fruit + " pie")
print(fruits)

    Output:
apple
apple pie
banana
banana pie
chikoo
chikoo pie
["apple","banana","chikoo"]

Note how the code indented inside the loop gets repeated over and over again.
But the code outside it gets executed only once. 

    游릳Practise Problem 1: Average Height

student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
#Here you will input a list of heights separated by a spacebar.

total = 0
count = 0

for student in student_heights:
    total += student
    count += 1
    average_height = round(total/count)
    
print(average_height)


    游릳Practise Problem 2: Highest Score

student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()

for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)

highest_score = 0
for score in student_scores:
  if score > highest_score:
    highest_score = score
print(f"The highest score in the class is: {highest_score}")


        游늸Range function

The range function creates a range of given numbers with provided start and end number.

游린Example 1:
for number in range(1,11):
    print(number)

Note that the output will print numbers from 1 to 10.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

游린Example 2:
for number in range(1,11, 2):
    print(number)

Note that the output will print all odd numbers from 1 to 10.
1 3 5 7 9

游린Example 3:
total = 0
for number in range(1,101):
    total += number
print(total)

Note that the output gives the total sum of all number from 1 to 100.
5050

游린Example 4:
total = 0
for number in range(1, 101):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        total += number
print(total)

Note that output prints sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

This exact same output can be obtained by using the following approach:

total = 0
for number in range(2, 101, 2):
    total += number
print(total)

for number in range(1,101):
    if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif number % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif number % 5  == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    elif number % 3 != 0 and number % 5 != 0:
        print(number)
