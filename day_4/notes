            Randomization and Lists

        
        📍Python has a built-in random number generator module.
import random
random.randint(a,b)

where a and b define the range between which the random integer is to be generated. 

random.random()
this one generates a float number between the range (0,1] where 0 is included and 1 is not.
basically 0.000000 to 0.99999999.

So, if you want a floating number between 0 to 5, then you can simply do this:
random.random() * 5


    🟨Example 1: Heads or Tails

import random
random_side = random.randint(0,1)
if random_side == 1:
	print("Heads")
else:
	print("Tails")


        📍Python Lists

Lists in python are defined as shown:
listname = [item1, item2, item3]

We can change and update list values using appropriate indexing methods. 
The append function can add items to the very end of the list.
listname.append("item4")

We can add multiple elements to the end using extend function.
listname.extend(["item5", "item6", "item7"])


    🟨Example 2: Random Bill Payer

import random
#input everyone's names
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")
#Split the inputted names into a list
names = names_string.split(", ")

#so let's say we have 5 total people. then 5 is the length of that list. So 4 will be
#last index in that list, i.e 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
final_index = len(names) - 1
#tell the computer to choose between 0 and that last index we got
choice = random.randint(0, final_index)
#assign that random number to get a name from our indexed list.
person_paying = names[choice]
print(person_paying + " is going to buy the meal today!")
#This can be substituted by using choice() function that will randomly choose a thing from a given list.

Remember that you can index a particular list using a given variable which has a numerical value.
For example, in the above case, we used "choice" as a variable with a numeric value to index the "names" list.
