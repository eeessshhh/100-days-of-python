            '''Topic: Working with variables to manage data.'''

We use Python strings to describe text and alphanumeric data.

The newline operator '\n' acts as an Enter button and prints code on a whole new line.
print("Hello!\n How are you doing today?")

The + sign is used to concatenate two strings together.
print("Hello" + "Angela")

If you need to define a string or sentence that has double quotes in it, you can use single quotes to define the string as follows:
print('e.g. print("Hello" + "world")')
Output: e.g. print("Hello" + "world")

To take input from the user, we use input() function.
Example:
print("Hello!" + input("What is your name?"))
Output:
The user will first be prompted for their name and then Hello Name will be printed.

Moving on to some practise examples.

    Practise Example 1: Name Length Measurer

        name = input("What is your name?")
        print(len(name))
#Takes input from user and calculates length of the string.

    Practise Example 2: Variable value swapping

        a = input("a: ")
        b = input("b: ")

        c = a
        a = b 
        b = c

#We are assigning the value of the first variable to a temporary third variable.
#Basically transferring stuff between three cups of which two are filled.

        print("a: " + a)
        print("b: " + b)
