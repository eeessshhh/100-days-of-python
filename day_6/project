            Day 6 Project: Reeborg Any-Maze Solver

def turn_right():
    turn_left()

while not at_goal():
    if right_is_clear():
        turn_right()
        move()
    elif front_is_clear():
        move()

        turn_left()

This code will help Reeborg navigate through any maze, no matter where it is positioned in the maze, 
or where the walls are placed in the randomly generated mazes.
