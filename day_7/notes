            HANGMAN

We begin by understanding how hangman works and framing a flowchart for the code.
Now we tackle the first challenge.

🟨 CHALLENGE 1:
It has four parts as follows:

📌TODO-1 - Make a word list and import the random module. 
import random
word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]

📌TODO-2 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word.
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)

📌TODO-3 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.
guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

📌TODO-4 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word.
for letter in chosen_word:
  if guess == letter:
    print("Yes")
  else:
    print("No")

🟨 CHALLENGE 2:
This step has three new tasks to complete.

import random
word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)

#Testing code
print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

📌TODO-1: - Create an empty List called display. For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'.

display = []
word_length = len(chosen_word)
for _ in range(word_length):
  display += "_"
print(display)

guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

📌TODO-2: - Loop through each position in the chosen_word;
If the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen word was "apple", then display should be ["_", "p", "p", "_", "_"].

for position in range(word_length):
    letter = chosen_word[position]
    if letter == guess:
        display[position] = letter

📌TODO-3: - Print 'display' and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position and every other letter replace with "_".

print(display)


🟨 CHALLENGE 3:
In this we only tackle one new task.

import random

word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
word_length = len(chosen_word)

#Testing code
print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

#Create blanks
display = []
for _ in range(word_length):
    display += "_"

📌TODO-1: - Use a while loop to let the user guess again. The loop should only stop once the user has guessed all the letters in the chosen_word and 'display' has no more blanks ("_"). Then you can tell the user they've won.

end_of_game = False

while end_of_game == False:

    guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

    #Check guessed letter
    for position in range(word_length):
        letter = chosen_word[position]
        print(f"Current position: {position}\n Current letter: {letter}\n Guessed letter: {guess}")
        if letter == guess:
            display[position] = letter

    print(display)

    if "_" not in display:
        end_of_game = True
        print("You win.")



🟨 CHALLENGE 4:

📌TODO-1: - Create a variable called 'lives' to keep track of the number of lives left. Set 'lives' to equal 6.
lives = 6

#Testing code
print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

#Create blanks
display = []

        if letter == guess:
            display[position] = letter

📌TODO-2: - If guess is not a letter in the chosen_word,Then reduce 'lives' by 1. 
If lives goes down to 0 then the game should stop and it should print "You lose."

    if guess not in chosen_word:
        lives -= 1
        if lives == 0: 
            end_of_game = True

    #Check if user has got all letters.
    if "_" not in display:
        end_of_game = True
        print("You win.")

📌TODO-3: - print the ASCII art from 'stages' that corresponds to the current number of 'lives' the user has remaining.
    print(stages[lives])


🟨 FINAL OUTCOME CODE 🟨
(The hangman_art and hangman_words are supplementary python files/modules created within the replit to be pulled from externally.)
Nothing fancy, they are just two separate lists saved as .py files.

from replit import clear
#This clear module clears the screen after every guess so the ASCII art doesn't keep getting piled up.
