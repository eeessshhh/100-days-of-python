            Conditional Statements and Logical Operators


        ðŸ“ŒComparison Operators
            >       Greater than
            <       Less than
            >=      Greater than equal to
            <=      Less than equal to 
            ==      Exactly equal to 
            !=      Not equal to 

#Remember that = is the assignment operator and == is the equal to operator.



ðŸŸ¨Example 1: Odd-Even 
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("This is an even number.")
else:
    print("This is an odd number.")


        ðŸ“ŒWe can have if elif else statements, nested if statements and multiple if statements.


ðŸŸ¨Example 2: Rollercoaster 

print("Welcome to the Rollercoaster!")
height = input("What is your height in cm?")
bill = 0

if height > 120:
    print("Yes, you can ride the rollercoaster!")
    age = int(input("How old are you?"))
    if age <= 12:
        bill += 5
    elif 12 < age <= 18:
        bill += 7
    elif 45 <= age <= 55:
        bill = 0
    else:
        bill += 12 
    
photo = input("Do you want photos?")
    if photo == Y:
        bill += 3
    else:
        bill += 0

else:
    print("Sorry you're not tall enough!")

print(f"The total bill is {bill}")



ðŸŸ¨Example 3: BMI Calculator
h = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
w = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))

bmi = round((w / h ** 2))

if bmi <= 18.5:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight.")
elif 18.5 < bmi <= 25:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you have a normal weight.")
elif 25 < bmi <= 30:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif 30 < bmi <= 35:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi} , you are obese.")
elif bmi > 35:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are clinically obese.")
else:
    print(f"Please enter correct height and weight values.")


ðŸŸ¨Example 3: Leap Year Calculator
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
if year % 4 == 0:
  if year % 100 == 0:
    if year % 400 == 0:
      print("Leap year.")
    else:
      print("Not leap year.")
  else:
    print("Leap year.")
else:
  print("Not leap year.")


ðŸŸ¨Example 4: Pizza Bill Calculator
print("Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries!")
size = input("What size pizza do you want? S, M, or L ")
add_pepperoni = input("Do you want pepperoni? Y or N ")
extra_cheese = input("Do you want extra cheese? Y or N ")

bill = 0

if size == "S":
  bill += 15
elif size == "M":
  bill += 20
else:
  bill += 25

if add_pepperoni == "Y":
  if size == "S":
    bill += 2
  else:
    bill += 3
    
if extra_cheese == "Y":
  bill += 1
  
print(f"Your final bill is: ${bill}.")


            ðŸ“ŒLogical Operators:
            and     both A and B have to be true     
            or      only one can be true
            not     reverses the meaning of a condition


ðŸŸ¨Example 5: Love Calculator
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")

combined_names = name1 + name2
lower_names = combined_names.lower()
t = lower_names.count("t")
r = lower_names.count("r")
u = lower_names.count("u")
e = lower_names.count("e")
first_digit = t + r + u + e

l = lower_names.count("l")
o = lower_names.count("o")
v = lower_names.count("v")
e = lower_names.count("e")
second_digit = l + o + v + e

score = int(str(first_digit) + str(second_digit))

if (score < 10) or (score > 90):
  print(f"Your score is {score}, you go together like coke and mentos.")
elif (score >= 40) and (score <= 50):
  print(f"Your score is {score}, you are alright together.")
else:
  print(f"Your score is {score}.")
