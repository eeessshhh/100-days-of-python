            Data Types, Operators and fstrings

Four Primary Data Types in Python: 
STRING          "1234"
INTEGER          1234
LARGE INT        120_000_000
FLOAT            12.34
BOOLEAN          TRUE

One can check variable type using type() function

       
        📍 Understanding Strings v/s Integers       
           
            print("123" + "456")
            Result: 123456

            print(123 + 456)
            Result: 579


        📍 Type conversions:
                str()
                int()
                float()

🟦Example 1:

input_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")

digit_one = int(input_number[0])
digit_two = int(input_number[1])

output = digit_one + digit_two
print(output)



        📍Order of Python priorities: PEMDASLR 
            Parentheses 
            Exponents 
            Multiplication 
            Division 
            Addition 
            Subtraction 
            Left to Right priority

🟦Example 2: BMI Calculator

height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")

h = float(height)
w = float(weight)
bmi = int(w / (h ** 2))
print(bmi)



        📍Round function
            round(number, ndigits)
        where number is the number you want to round off, and ndigits is how many decimals you want to round it off to.

        📍Increment Operator
            score = 0
            score += 5
            print(score)



🟦Example 3: Life in weeks

a = input("What is your current age? ")
age = int(a)

years_left = 90 - age

days_left = int(years_left * 365)
weeks_left = int(years_left * 52)
months_left = int(years_left * 12)

print(f"You have {days_left} days, {weeks_left} weeks, and {months_left} months left.")

#The fstring makes sure you don't have to worry about data types while printing any statements with variable values in it.
