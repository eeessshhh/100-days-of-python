'''
We define a function find_highest_bidder which initializes highest_bid to 0.
It then accesses the value of the key from bids dictionary and compares it to the highest bid value of 0.
Finds highest amount and then assigns a winner.

'''
A while loop that takes key-value input from user and adds to the bids dictionary.
Then it decides whether to continue the auction or not.
If yes, it clears the screen for the next bidder.
If no, it calls upon the function defined earlier and announces winner.
