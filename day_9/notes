            Dictionaries and Nesting

üìç Each dictionary has key and value pairs. {Key: Value}

For better readability, programmers write it as follows:
#They use commas after each entry, including the last one.
#They indent each entry after the curly bracket in the beginning.

name_of_dictionary = {
    "key1": "value",
    "key2": "value",
    "key3": "value",
}

To retreive a particular entry, we can call it as follows:
print(name_of_dictionary["key1"])

To add a new entry to the dictionary:
name_of_dictionary["key4"] = "value"

One can create an empty dictionary like so...
empty_dict = {}

... and then add items later on as we saw just now.
