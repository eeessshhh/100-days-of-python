            Dictionaries and Nesting

📍 Each dictionary has key and value pairs. {Key: Value}

For better readability, programmers write it as follows:
#They use commas after each entry, including the last one.
#They indent each entry after the curly bracket in the beginning.

name_of_dictionary = {
    "key1": "value",
    "key2": "value",
    "key3": "value",
}

📍To retreive a particular entry, we can call it as follows:
print(name_of_dictionary["key1"])

📍To add a new entry to the dictionary:
name_of_dictionary["key4"] = "value"

📍One can create an empty dictionary like so...
empty_dict = {}

... and then add items later on as we saw just now.

📍In order to loop through a dictionary:
for key in name_of_dictionary:
    print(key)
    print(name_of_dictionary[key])

This will print out both key-value pairs. 
If you write only print(key), the values for those keys will not be printed out in the terminal.

🟨Example 1: Grading Program using looping through Dictionaries.

student_scores = {
  "Harry": 81,
  "Ron": 78,
  "Hermione": 99, 
  "Draco": 74,
  "Neville": 62,
}

# TODO-1: Create an empty dictionary called student_grades.
student_grades = {}

# TODO-2: Covert scores into grades.
for student in student_scores:
  score = student_scores[student]
  if score > 90:
    student_grades[student] = "Outstanding"
  elif score > 80:
    student_grades[student] = "Exceeds Expectations"
  elif score > 70:
    student_grades[student] = "Acceptable"
  else:
    student_grades[student] = "Fail"
    
print(student_grades)

Nesting a list in a dictionary, which is nested in another dictionary:

travel_log: {
    "Maharashtra": {"cities_visited": ["Mumbai","Pune","Nagpur"], "total_visits": 20},
    "Karnataka": {"cities_visited": ["Mangalore","Bengaluru","Mysore"], "total_visits": 26},
}

travel_log: {
    {"country_visited": "Maharashtra", "cities_visited": ["Mumbai","Pune","Nagpur"], "total_visits": 20},
    {"country_visited": "Karnataka", "cities_visited": ["Mangalore","Bengaluru","Mysore"], "total_visits": 26},
}
